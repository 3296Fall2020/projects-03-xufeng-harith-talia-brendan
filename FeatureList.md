# Planned Features to be Implemented

## Notifications
The application will send a notification to a user's computer/laptop whenever it detects a delivery-man leaving package.
## Identifying delivery-men
Knock Knock will additionally be able to identify what kind of delivery-man is at the door (Amazon, FedEx, USPS, etc.)
## Creating a traffic log
A daily report will be sent to the user, describing all information recorded. This includes package presence, type of delivery-man, timestamps, and potential thiefs/strangers.
